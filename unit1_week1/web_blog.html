        <h2><a href="http://wwww.apple.com"><strong>Apple.com</strong></a></h2>
        <h3>About</h3>
      		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."><em>Apple Inc.</em></a> creates some of the best consumer electronics on the market. Their products revolve around simplicity and are known for their high quality. Thankfully, Apple took this approach with their website which provides an extremely user friendly experience by maintaining organization and optimization.</p>
      	<h3>At first glance...</h3>
      		<img id="capture" src="C:\Users\Kai\Documents\GitHub\kaiprt.github.io\unit1_week1\images\Apple_Capture.png">
      		<p>Apple.com has truly pioneered the web. It is a human factors masterpiece! At first glance you are immediately sucked into center screen where Apple places its most notable information. Below are four squares of sub-content that seamlessly match the width of the main content block. At a distance you might be drawn into how artistic the site's design is. Every image seems to be perfectly placed to provide positive emotions.</p>
      	<h3>If I could describe Apple.com in 5 words:</h3>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Visual</li>
      			<li>Simple</li>
      			<li>Uplifting</li>
      			<li>Elegant</li>
      			<li>Artistic</li>
      		</ul>
      	<h3>Does Apple.com solve ANY problems?</h3>
      	<p>If anything Apple.com provides an excellent example of usability, performance, and marketing with a perfect ratio of text to media content. Moving from page to page is quite easy and the navigation is set up in a tree like hierarchy keeping everything nice and neat.</p>
      <h3>Apple's content is:</h3>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Visual</li>
      		<li>Simple</li>
      		<li>Straight-forward</li>
      		<li>Balanced</li>
      		<li>Quality</li>
      	</ul>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      	<p>Today, a website reflects the image of a company. After looking through this site there is no wonder why Apple is one of the most respected companies in the world.</p>

      <section id="lamborghini">
        <h2><a href="http://www.lamborghini.com/en/home"><strong>Lamborghini.com</strong></a></h2>
        <h3>About</h3>
      		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini"><em>Automobili Lamborghini</em></a>... need I say more? Lamborghini produces some of the fastest (most expensive) cars in the world.</p>
      	<h3>At first glance...</h3>
      		<img id="capture" src="C:\Users\Kai\Documents\GitHub\kaiprt.github.io\unit1_week1\images\Lamborghini_Capture.png">
      		<p>Lamborghini's homepage is centered around one large content display. The design is set up to have its "hot" content flip through in a slide-show format which instantly draws the user to the center. The website navigation is on the top left with multiple tabs. When clicking on a tab a bar expands downward to reveal more specific content under the navigational tabs. On all pages the "Home" button is consistently in the top left of the screen along with language options providing great international accessibility. </p>
      	<h3>If I could describe Lamborghini.com in 5 words:</h3>
      		<ul>
      			<li>Dynamic</li>
      			<li>Cinematic</li>
      			<li>Action-Packed</li>
      			<li>Informative</li>
      			<li>Freakin_Awesome!!! (I made that one word so it counts, okay? ;) )</li>
      		</ul>
      	<h3>Does Lamborghini.com solve ANY problems?</h3>
      	<p>Absolutely not. This site isn't even for potential buyers. This site is more to generate attention than sales.</p>
      <h3>Lamborghini's content is:</h3>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Visual</li>
      		<li>Informative</li>
      		<li>Themed</li>
      		<li>Lengthy</li>
      		<li>Technical</li>
      	</ul>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      	<p>Lamborghini certainly has one of the most dynamic auto company websites that provides an entire encyclopedia's worth of information about the company and its cars. It is well organized but lengthy and I seem to only visit the website for the visuals and interactive content. In my opinion, Lamborghini.com is one of the best car sites and the No. 1 exotic car site.</p>
