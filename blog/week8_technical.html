      <h2><strong>Dynamic vs. Static Typed Languages</strong> (Week 8)<h2>
      <article id="introduction">
        <p>
          Dynamic and Static Languages both have there pros and cons my job today is to teach you what I have learned so far in the debate between Dynamic typed languages and Static typed languages.

        <h2>Static Typed Languages</h2>
        <p>
          Static type-checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes a static type-checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type-safety properties for all possible inputs. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type-checking">Wikipedia</a>) This is beneficial because it is easier to detect programming mistakes, more opportunities for compiler optimizatons that can lead one to believe a well typed program cannot go wrong. Some examples of static languages include assembly languages, C, C++, Objective-C, and Java.

        <p>
          Benefits of static programming:</br>
          <ul>
            <li>Static languages are easier to read because theyâ€™re more explicit about what the code does.</li>
            <li>Static typing catches bugs with the compiler and keeps you out of trouble.</li>
          </ul>

          A language is dynamically typed if the type of a variable is interpreted at runtime. This allows programmers to work more quickly because the type does not have to be specified everytime. Also the code appears to be much "softer". A dynmaic programmer may find static languages to be "rigid". The downfall of a dynamic language is the fact that you cannot find errors as quickly as its competitor. I believe this is countered by creating assert statements, drivercode, and using test-driven development. Examples of Dynamic languages include Perl, Ruby, JavaScript and Python.
        </p>
        <p>Benefits from dynmaic programming:
          <ul>
            <li>Dynamic languages are easier to read because you write less code.</li>
            <li>Programming is faster</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully you found this helpful when comparing static vs dynamically typed languages. It's hard to say if one is better than the other but I find that it's individual preference.</p>
