      <h2>How do you feel when thinking about your values?</h2>
        <p>
          I am confident in my values and what they represent. I feel that my values reflect me as a person and I am appreciative that I discovered this at a young age.</br>
        </p>
      <h2>Do you think they can help you mediate stereotype threat?</h2>
        <p>
        My most important value is <em>leadership</em>. I recommend reading my <a href="http://kaiprt.github.io/blog/week2_cultural_blog.html">Week 2: Cultural Blog</a> expands on my values and how I feel about them. I believe leadership is a very important key to mediating the stereotype threat. Using leadership one could eliminate the stereotype threat in any reasonable situation. Unfortunately, the following values I endorse do not have as much power as leadership does during altercations. However, these values help strengthen an individuals tolerance against the stereotype threat.

      <h2>Exercises to help feeling down at DevBootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          Personally, I am completely confident I will not feel "down" at DBC. I am excited to learn and meet new people in a city filled with life, interaction, and opportunity. I believe preparing and preventive maintenance prevent me from feeling this way. I use the following exercises to keep me positive, optimistic, and upbeat.
          <ul>
            <li>Physical Exercise- relieves stress and releases positive endorphins.</li>
            <li>Yoga/Meditation- balances the mind and brings peace.</li>
            <li>Dream- whenever you mind is idle <strong>DREAM</strong> it will embed your goals into your subconscious and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction">Law of Attraction</a> will be put into work.</li>
            <li>Motivate- if you feel like your drifting into a mental tailspin then listen to speeches and watch videos of people who succeed in the face of adversity. You will instantly realize you are more than capable of accomplishing what you desire.</li>
            <li>Live through others success- this is a result from becoming a good leader and will allow you to see the positive in life.</li>
            <li>Religion- everybody has different values and thoughts on this subject. Respect other's opinions and be true to yours!</li>
          </ul>
