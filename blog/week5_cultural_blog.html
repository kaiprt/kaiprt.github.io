        <h2>Problems Facing the Tech World: Security</h2>
        <p>
          Security is one of the most important problems facing technology. Every year millions of people's devices are hacked. Last year, Target was hacked and 40 million of their customers had their debit and credit card information stolen. Recently, there was the <em><a href="http://lifehacker.com/what-the-heartbleed-security-bug-means-for-you-1560801201">HeartBleed</a></em> bug that exposes encrypted transactions to cyber-attackers. "Security experts warn potential harm from the Heartbleed bug could go far beyond major Internet companies, penetrating to the inner workings of the web and devices that connect to it" -The New York Times. Millions of personal accounts are hacked each year.</br></br> 

          In recent years technology has become very personal. Your phone's ability to store your credit card information, location, emails, along with syncing to "the cloud" all put users at a high risk. I understand that technology will always have its "holes" but I believe there has to be a better way to protect users from data theft. I believe we can increase security on both the developer's end and the user's end.</br></br>

          Developers should always check if their code is secure by avoiding injection attacks, designing secure user interfaces, and create validation processes. This concept can also help protect developers from software pirating. </br></br>

          Users can do a number of things to secure themselves.
            <ul>
              <li>Create Tough Passwords</li>
              <li>Share Less Information</li>
              <li>Back Up Data</li>
              <li>Update Software Frequently</li>
            </ul>
          Users should also send feedback and error reports so developers can look for solutions.</br></br>
          The worst cyber-attack is yet to come and we should all do our best to protect our data and create secure, trustworthy technology.
