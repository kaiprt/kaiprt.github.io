          The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">Stereotype Threat</a> is the idea that there exists a threat felt in particular situations in which stereotypes relate to an individual and the mere knowledge of the stereotype can be distracting enough to negatively affect one's performance.</br></br>

          I have conducted some basic research and I have noticed that this is due to a negative environment (one not in favor of the minority) which negatively affects an individuals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs"><em>Hierarchy of Needs</em></a>.

          Specifically, the Stereotype Threat affects the <em>esteem</em> sector of the triangle. I believe all of these "needs" are interconnected. When one is negatively affected it affects all sectors. For example, I have created an ordered list describing the process of the Stereotypical Threat.
          <ol>
            <li>Individual is placed in situation where a stereotype threat is active.</li>
            <li>Individual's stress is aroused due to lack of "Belonging".</li>
            <li>Individual begins to monitor performance in order to increase esteem and discover the factor that removed "Belonging".</li>
            <li>Individual realizes that it is impossible to change the factor since stereotypes are spawned in the minds of others.</li>
            <li>Individual begins to suppress negative thoughts associated with stereotype and stress which in return raises anxiety.</li>
            <li>Self-actualization and esteem begin to fall.</li>
            <li>Individual disengages from situations where they feel threatened by the stereotype. This perception of threat lowers the feeling of "Security/Safety".</li>
            <li>Individual distances themselves from negative environment and avoid negatively stereotyped groups in order to have the Hierarchy of Needs returned to a stable level.</li>  
        </p></br>
        <p>
          Personally, I have never experienced this but I have lived my entire life in an area where this is not too common. However, my African American grandfather experienced situations of stereotypical threat his entire life. After speaking with my grandfather, I have found that it these stereotypic threats did not phase him and in fact boost his drive and determination to become as successful as he is today. In return, his achievements felt more rewarding and that increased his "Self-Actualization."

          Even though I have not experienced stereotype threats first-hand I feel that I can help others who may feel it. I would break down the factors behind the concept so they could understand what they are going through on a more intimate level. I would give positive feedback that is tailored to every individual which levels the playing field so performance and effort are the only factors. In order to make the environment more welcoming every individual would be treated fairly and equally. Lastly, I would openly ask for feedback and lead by example in order to improve the environment.
