      <article id="introduction">
        <p>In this blog I discuss <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table</a>. I find it best that you watch the first 20 minutes of video because it is very inspiring and you can relate more to my blog.</p>

        <h2>Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?</h2>
        <p>
          Words cannot describe how excited I am to head to DBC. I feel like it was everything I dreamed of. I could directly relate to everything that Shereef discussed and I believe in the mindset that he has. Everything from the interviewing process to my last days in prep have been amazing and I can't believe how much I have learned. This is the best experience you can get outside of a career.
        </p>
        <h2>What is your impression of DBC?</h2>
        <p>
          I have a great impression (to the point that it supersedes university studies) of DBC and the people who run it. 
        </p>
        <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
        <p>
          I am directly engaged with the DBC culture. It has completely changed my life. For the first time I will be surrounded by an optimistic, creative, humble, and passionate group of individuals that are all working towards the same goal. I have dreamed for a moment like this. I feel that I have a true purpose.
