            <li>Accepting even positive criticism</li>
          </ul>
        </p></br>
      <h2>Concrete Sequential</h2>
        <p>This Learner Likes:
        <ul>
          <li>order</li>
          <li>logical sequence</li>
          <li>following directions, predictability</li>
          <li>getting facts</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>They learn best when:
          <ul>
            <li>they have a structured environment</li>
            <li>they can rely on others to complete this task</li>
            <li>are faced with predictable situations</li>
            <li>can apply ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>What's hard for them?
          <ul>
            <li>Working in groups</li>
            <li>Discussions that seem to have no specific point</li>
            <li>Working in an unorganized environment</li>
            <li>Following incoplete or unclear directions</li>
            <li>Working with unpredictable people</li>
            <li>Dealing with abstract ideas</li>
            <li>Demands to "use your imagination"</li>
            <li>Questions with no right or wrong answers</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>To sum it up, abstract random thinkers organize information throug reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments and concrete sequential thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way. I feel that I have key strengths that will propel me at DevBootcamp and the hybrid style I have will make me a well rounded programmer.
        </p>
        <p>However, I do not believe I share all of the weaknesses this chart states. In order to build off my weaknesses I will seek help from faculty and students. If I have time I will research ways to overcome this.
