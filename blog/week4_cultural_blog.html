        <h2>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h2>
        <p>
          A couple of months ago I had an argument with my mother about what I wanted to do with my life. I made a decision to stop school at my college and my mother was not happy. However, I wanted to leave because I felt that college was too slow paced in the "<em>Information Age</em>" and my mother looked at it from another prospective.

          <h2>What was the source of conflict?</h2>
          <p>
            I had the best intentions when making my decision to go through and leave. I believe the culprits were poor communication, different values, and differing interests.

          <h2>How did you handle the conflict?</h2>
          <p>
            Increased communication and presented a well crafted explanation that explained my thoughts, feelings, motives, and emotions towards the subject.
            I shed light on my value in order to give my mother a greater understanding.

          <h2>Did you actions make the conflict better or worse?</h2>
          <p>
            Handling the conflict the way I did decreased the conflict.

          <h2>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h2>
          <p>
            I would have explained my thoughts and feelings before hand to avoid the conflict all together.

          <h2>What did you learn from this experience?</h2>
          <p>
            That you should always stick to what you believe in and take everything with a grain of salt.
