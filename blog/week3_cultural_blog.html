          <h2>My Thoughts on Pairing</h2>

        <p>
          Pairing is writing source code of a program with a team consisting of two individuals. I found it to be fun working with another person and I find it very beneficial when solving challenges. It definately makes coding feel more social. Furthermore, pairing feels more rewarding. I believe this was due to the sense of "hyperdrive" while writing the code because of the ability to bounce ideas off one another to achieve desired results in a timely fashion. I did not find my experiences to be frustrating at all but I know it could if your partner appears to be stubborn or reserved.

          <h2>Feeling the Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            As of this moment, I have not received any feedback. However, I have written feedback to numerous individuals. Writing feedback was enjoyable. It helped me really analyze my classmates on a personal and intellectual scale. The hardest part about writing feedback is the wording. You want to make sure you write clear, kind, and actionable so your partner can improve their skillset. Feedback is important because it helps expose faults and guide an individuals development. Giving strong feedback is important for leadership (my favorite value) because it helps others achieve their own success.
