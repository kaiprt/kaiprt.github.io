      <h2><strong>Ruby- Classes!</strong> (Week 3)<h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Ruby gives you the ability to make classes and objects making it one of the more powerful object-oriented programming languages. Creating a class is very helpful since Ruby will never have all the kind of objects that we want! Classes are an instance of the class <em>Class</em> and you can easily create them by using this syntax:</br>
          <br>
          class Name </br>
          <em># => describe behavior</em></br>
          end</br></br>
          You can create your own methods for a specific class too which is very beneficial. Personally, I love cars... so lets make a car class!</br></br>
          <img src="Blog_Images/class_code_car.png"></br></br>
          In the code above I created two methods <em>initialize</em> and <em>info</em> these methods can only be used if an object is apart of the Car class we defined. Within the method <em>initialize</em> I assigned a few "instance variabels". These variables can be used and referenced in any method I create within the car class. I comfirm this by writing the method <em>info</em> and setting it to print a script (puts) that accesses the instance variables created in the <em>initialize</em> method. If instance variables are not defined then other methods in the same class cannot retrieve the information from previous methods.</br>
          Well it looks like that should be a good jumpstart for you! I hope you enjoyed the article and if you have any questions please dont hesitate to <a href="mailto:kaiprt@gmail.com">-->EMAIL ME<--</a>.
