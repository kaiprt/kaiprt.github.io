      <h2><strong>Ruby- What exactly is looping?</strong> (Week 3)<h2>
      <article>
        <p> In the Ruby programming language loops are used to execute the same block of code a specific number of times until a condition is met. There are a few basic loops:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>While- a while loop executes a block of code as long as the statement in the block remains true.</li>
          <li>Until- similiar to a while loop except it executes while the condition is false until true.</li>
          <li>For- executes the block of code once for each element in an expression.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When choosing the right loop to use for your code it is important to assess what you want to accomplish in the loop. Lets say you want to right a block that puts a statement until a certain number. You would want the count to start from 0 and go to n. A while loop would be the best option for this instance because any number from 0 to n is less than or equal to n which a computer evaluates as <em>true</em>. If we used an until loop we would want the code to evaluate as false until true which doesn't quite make sense in our block because what we are evaluating is <em>true</em>. The for loop is like a hybrid between loops and iterators in Ruby. The for loop can go over values in a range or array.</p></br>
        <p>We could possibly use a for loop in our block by writing:</br>
        for i in 1..10</br>
        --> print "{i} "</br>
        end</br>
        However, iterators are sometimes the best and cleanest option when writing code... but we will cover that another day!
